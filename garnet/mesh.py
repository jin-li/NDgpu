"""Unstructured finite-volume diffusion on a Gmsh mesh.

Reads a Gmsh 2.2 ``.msh`` file -- 2D triangle/quad cells, or 3D tetrahedra,
hexahedra and prisms -- and solves the multigroup k-eigenvalue diffusion problem
on the arbitrary geometry it describes, the same job FEMFFUSION or GeN-Foam do
from a mesh rather than from a structured lattice. This is the general-geometry
escape hatch: where the structured Cartesian/hex operators need a lattice, this
one needs only cells, their vertices, and per-cell materials.

The scheme is a cell-centred two-point-flux finite volume: for a face shared by
cells i and j, the 2D coupling is A_face / (d_i / D_i + d_j / D_j), where
d_i and d_j are centroid-to-face distances projected on the face normal.
This is consistent on orthogonal meshes; skewed interfaces (including hanging
nodes) retain a conservative TPFA approximation without a nonorthogonal flux
correction. Legacy/manual and 3D meshes without these distances use the harmonic
mean coefficient times face measure over centroid separation. Boundary faces
get the Robin/albedo term (vacuum alpha = 1/2).
The connectivity is irregular, but
the within-group operator is still applied matrix-free as a pure *gather*: the
faces are stored as a row-wise ELLPACK adjacency (each cell's neighbours padded
to the maximum degree), and the apply reads each cell's neighbour fluxes and
combines them with per-slot weights -- no scatter, hence no GPU atomics, and a
coalesced write, the same access pattern that makes the structured stencils fast
on CUDA. The single NumPy/CuPy code path runs on CPU or GPU and reuses the
structured solvers' Jacobi/Neumann-PCG, putting the general-geometry track on the
GPU alongside the structured lattices rather than the earlier SciPy sparse direct
factorisation. Power iteration drives the outer fission source.
